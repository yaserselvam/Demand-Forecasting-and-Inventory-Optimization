# Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization Using Python

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a Python-based project for **Demand Forecasting** and **Inventory Optimization**, leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques. It is designed to predict future demand accurately and optimize inventory levels, ensuring efficiency and cost savings in supply chain management.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Demand Forecasting**: 
  - Time series analysis using ARIMA, SARIMA, or machine learning models like XGBoost or LSTM.
  - Data visualization for trends, seasonality, and patterns.
- **Inventory Optimization**: 
  - Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) calculations.
  - Safety stock level determination.
  - Real-time alerts for understock and overstock scenarios.
- **Interactive Dashboards**:
  - Visual insights using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and Statsmodels.
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook.
